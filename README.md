# 🦷 Basic Patient Booking System

A simple full-stack application for managing dental appointments, built with **Spring Boot** and **Vite + React**. The system allows users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** patient appointments, with access and permissions depending on the user's role.

This project simulates a dental clinic appointment system set in **Mandaue City, Philippines**.

## 💻 Running the App Locally

### NOTE: THERE IS NO INITIALIZED DATA FOR THE DOCTORS
YOU HAVE TO REGISTER AS A DOCTOR FIRST BEFORE YOU REGISTER AS A PATIENT (WILL ADD FAKE DATA SOON)

### 1. 🛠 Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
> Make sure MySQL is installed and running on your machine.

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ** (or your preferred IDE).
2. Make sure your `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file has the correct MySQL configuration.
3. Locate the `DentalApplication.java` file (usually in `src/main/java/com/dentalHCI/dental/DentalApplication.java`).
4. Right-click the file and choose `Run 'DentalApplication.main()'` to start the backend API server.

The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:9080`.

---

### 2. 🎨 Frontend Setup (Vite + React)

> Make sure you have the latest version of node installed
1. Open a terminal in the frontend project folder.
2. Install dependencies:

```poweshell
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```poweshell
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:5173
